Before embarking on my master’s journey at the University of Edinburgh Business School (proud grad now! 🎓), I was part of the team at Miko, serving as a Marketing Operations Associate. My journey there began as a research intern and transitioned into a full-time role.

I proudly donned the hat of a Software Engineer graduate. And yep, I’m one of those who discovered her true passion during engineering 👩‍🔧. Although I no longer dabble in coding, I’ve held tight to all those essential engineering traits that helped me earn my degree and continue navigating the world! 😎 

These days, I’m working as a freelance marketing consultant - helping brands craft their strategy, understand their markets, and go to market with confidence 🚀
